<h2><a name="what.is.uima-ducc">1. What is UIMA-DUCC?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			DUCC stands for Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing. DUCC is a cluster management system providing tooling,
management, and scheduling facilities to automate the scale-out of applications written to the UIMA framework.
Core UIMA provides a generalized framework for applications that process unstructured information such as human
language, but does not provide a scale-out mechanism. UIMA-AS provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA
pipelines over a cluster of computing resources, but does not provide job or cluster management of the resources.
DUCC defines a formal job model that closely maps to a standard UIMA pipeline. Around this job model DUCC
provides cluster management services to automate the scale-out of UIMA pipelines over computing clusters.
