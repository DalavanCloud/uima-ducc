              Apache Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing (DUCC) Version 1.0.0 README
              
              
1. What is DUCC?
=========================================

DUCC stands for Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing. DUCC is a cluster management system providing tooling,
management, and scheduling facilities to automate the scale-out of applications written to the UIMA framework.
Core UIMA provides a generalized framework for applications that process unstructured information such as human
language, but does not provide a scale-out mechanism. UIMA-AS provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA
pipelines over a cluster of computing resources, but does not provide job or cluster management of the resources.
DUCC defines a formal job model that closely maps to a standard UIMA pipeline. Around this job model DUCC
provides cluster management services to automate the scale-out of UIMA pipelines over computing clusters.

2. Building from the Source Distribution
========================================
     
We use Maven 3.0 for building; download this if needed, 
and set the environment variable MAVEN_OPTS to -Xmx800m -XX:MaxPerSize-256m.

To build UIMA-DUCC, install Java SDK 6 or later.

Then build from the directory containing this README by issuing the command
   mvn clean install.
   
This builds everything except the ...source-release.zip file and DUCC documentation. 
To build documentation make sure you have LATEX installed and change the command to:

   mvn clean install.-Pbuild-duccdocs

To build everything including the ...source-release.zip, change the command to 

   mvn clean install -Papache-release
   
The above also builds DUCC documentation.   
   
Look for the result in the two artifacts: 
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-source-release.zip (if run with -Papache-release) and
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-bin.tar.gz

3. What's New in 1.0.0?
====================== 
  
UIMA DUCC 1.0.0 is the first Apache release. For up-to-date information on UIMA-DUCC 
issues, see our issue tracker: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-2663?jql=project%20%3D%20UIMA%20AND%20component%20&3D%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC

5. Installation and Setup
=========================

Please refer to docs/install.pdf for installation instructions.

5.1 Supported Platforms
-----------------------

UIMA-DUCC has been tested with Sun Java 6 as well as IBM Java 6 on Linux. The cluster of machines DUCC manages
must all be running a reasonably current level of Linux; other operating systems are not supported.
. 


6. Known problems/limitations with Release 1.0.0
================================================

a) Chapter 13.3 States: "Because non-preemptable allocations can’t be
   preempeted, work submitted to a class implementing one of the non-
   preemptable policies (FIXED or RESERVE) are never allowed to “squat” in other
   nodepools and are only scheduled on nodes in their proper nodepool."

   There are some situations where in fact, FIXED jobs can be scheduled into
   nodepools which are subsets of the nodepool the FIXED class is defined over.
   While technically a bug, there are also use cases for this behavior,
   especially on large systems.  If this causes problems, usually classes
   can be reconfigured to bypass the issue  The behavior is to be 
   addressed in a future release.

b) By default, we dont build DUCC documentation when doing mvn clean install. Building
   docs requires LATEX installed which is a considerable download (over 1 Gig).
   

Crypto Notice
-------------

   This distribution includes cryptographic software.  The country in 
   which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, 
   possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of 
   encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please 
   check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the

   The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
   Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity 
   Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
   software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
   algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
   distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
   ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS 
   Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object 
   code and source code.

   The following provides more details on the included cryptographic
   software:
   
   This distribution includes portions of Apache ActiveMQ, which, in
   turn, is classified as being controlled under ECCN 5D002.
