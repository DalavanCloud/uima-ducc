              Apache Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing (DUCC) Version 1.0.0 README
              
              
1. What is DUCC?
=========================================

DUCC stands for Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing. DUCC is a cluster management system providing tooling,
management, and scheduling facilities to automate the scale-out of applications written to the UIMA framework.
Core UIMA provides a generalized framework for applications that process unstructured information such as human
language, but does not provide a scale-out mechanism. UIMA-AS provides a scale-out mechanism to distribute UIMA
pipelines over a cluster of computing resources, but does not provide job or cluster management of the resources.
DUCC defines a formal job model that closely maps to a standard UIMA pipeline. Around this job model DUCC
provides cluster management services to automate the scale-out of UIMA pipelines over computing clusters.

2. Building from the Source Distribution
========================================
     
We use Maven 3.0 for building; download this if needed, 
and set the environment variable MAVEN_OPTS to -Xmx800m -XX:MaxPerSize-256m.

Then build from the directory containing this README by issuing the command
   mvn clean install.
   
This builds everything except the ...source-release.zip file. If you want that,
change the command to 

   mvn clean install -Papache-release
   
Look for the result in the two artifacts: 
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-source-release.zip (if run with -Papache-release) and
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-bin.tar.gz

   The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
   Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity 
   Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
   software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
   algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
   distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
   ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS 
   Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object 
   code and source code.

   The following provides more details on the included cryptographic
   software:
   
   This distribution includes portions of Apache ActiveMQ, which, in
   turn, is classified as being controlled under ECCN 5D002.
