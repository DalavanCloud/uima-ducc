              Apache Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing (DUCC) Version 1.0.0 README
              

1. Building from the Source Distribution
========================================
     
We use Maven 3.0 for building; download this if needed, 
and set the environment variable MAVEN_OPTS to -Xmx800m -XX:MaxPerSize-256m.

To build UIMA-DUCC, install Java SDK 6 or later.

Then build from the directory containing this README by issuing the command
   mvn clean install.
   
This builds everything except the ...source-release.zip file and DUCC documentation. 
To build documentation make sure you have LATEX installed and change the command to:

   mvn clean install.-Pbuild-duccdocs

To build everything including the ...source-release.zip, change the command to 

   mvn clean install -Papache-release
   
The above also builds DUCC documentation.   
   
Look for the result in the two artifacts: 
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-source-release.zip (if run with -Papache-release) and
   target/uima-ducc-[version]-bin.tar.gz

4. Installation and Setup
=========================

Please refer to docs/installation.pdf for installation instructions.

4.1 Supported Platforms
-----------------------

UIMA-DUCC has been tested with Sun Java 6 as well as IBM Java 6 on Linux. The cluster of machines DUCC manages
must all be running a reasonably current level of Linux; other operating systems are not supported.
. 


5. Known problems/limitations with Release 1.0.0
================================================

a) Chapter 13.3 States: "Because non-preemptable allocations can’t be
   preempeted, work submitted to a class implementing one of the non-
   preemptable policies (FIXED or RESERVE) are never allowed to “squat” in other
   nodepools and are only scheduled on nodes in their proper nodepool."

   There are some situations where in fact, FIXED jobs can be scheduled into
   nodepools which are subsets of the nodepool the FIXED class is defined over.
   While technically a bug, there are also use cases for this behavior,
   especially on large systems.  If this causes problems, usually classes
   can be reconfigured to bypass the issue  The behavior is to be 
   addressed in a future release.

b) By default, we dont build DUCC documentation when doing mvn clean install. Building
   docs requires LATEX installed which is a considerable download (over 1 Gig).
   

Crypto Notice
-------------

   This distribution includes cryptographic software.  The country in 
   which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, 
   possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of 
   encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please 
   check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the
   import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to 
   see if this is permitted.  See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more
   information.

   The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
   Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity 
   Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
   software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
   algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
   distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
   ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS 
   Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object 
   code and source code.

   The following provides more details on the included cryptographic
   software:
   
   This distribution includes portions of Apache ActiveMQ, which, in
   turn, is classified as being controlled under ECCN 5D002.
