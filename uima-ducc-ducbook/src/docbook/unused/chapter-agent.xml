<title>Overview - Node Agent</title>
  <para>UIMA Asynchronous Scaleout (AS) is a set of capabilities supported in the UIMA Framework for achieving
    scaleout that is more general than the approaches provided for in the Collection Processing Manager (CPM). AS is a
    second generation design, replacing the CPM and Vinci Services. The CPM and Vinci are still available and are not
    being deprecated, but new designs are encouraged to use AS for scalability, and current designs reaching
    limitations may want to move to AS.</para>
  <para>AS is integrated with the flow controller architecture, and can be applied to both primitive and aggregate
    analysis engines. </para>
