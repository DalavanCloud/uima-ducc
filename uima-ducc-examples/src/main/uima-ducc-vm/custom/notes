- customer pinger must extend AServicePing
  void init(endpoint);
  boolean ping();
  void stop();
  ServiceStatistics getStatistics();
       TODO - make ServiceStatics an interface
              String getServiceType();      - a label so ws can group like services together

           These two are parallel arrays.
              String[] getHeaders();        - gives meaning to the statistics
              long  [] getStatistics();     - up to 12 longs.  


   Uima - needs averageEnqueueTime from AMQ
          need average service time from UIMA-AS bean
          should circulate a cas to get serializatin and processing times

- Standard or custom numbers for non-UIMA service? 


The interface consists of:
- is the service up
