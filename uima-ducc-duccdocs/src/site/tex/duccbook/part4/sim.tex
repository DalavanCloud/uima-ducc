\chapter{Simulation and System Testing}
\label{chap:simulation}
    This chapter describes the large-scale testing and cluster-simulation 
    tools supplied with DUCC. This is of use mostly to contributors and 
    developers of DUCC itself.

    DUCC is shipped with support for simulating large clusters of arbitrarily 
    configured nodes.  A simple control file describes some number of
    simulated nodes of arbitrary memory sizes.  DUCC's design allows multiples
    of these to be spawned on a single node, or on a small set of nodes with 
    multiple simulated nodes apiece.  The standard testing configuration 
    used for most of the development of DUCC consisted of four
    physical 32-GB machines support 52 simulated nodes of varying memory
    sizes from 32 to 128-GB each.

    To simulate job loads, a simple UIMA-AS job that sleeps for some easily configured
    length of time was constructed.  Another control file is used to
    generate \hyperref[sec:cli.ducc-submit]{job specifications} requesting randomly-chosen
    job parameters such as memory requirements, service dependencies and so on.

    The test suite contains a simple Analysis Engine called
    {\tt FixedSleepAE}, and a simple Collection Reader called
    {\tt FixedSleepCR}.  The CR reads a set of sleep times, creates
    CASs, and ships them to the AEs via DUCC's Job Driver.  The CAS
    contains the time to sleep and various parameters regarding
    error injection.

    The AE receives a CAS, performs error injection if requested, and
    sleeps the indicated period of time, simulating actual computation
    but requiring very few physical resources.  Hence, many of these 
    may be run simultaneously on relatively modest hardware.

    Developers may construct arbitrary jobs by creating a file with
    sleep times designed to exercise what ever is necessary.  DUCC 
    ships with the three primary job collections (test suites) used
    during initial development.  The suites are based on actual 
    workloads and have shown to be very robust for proving the correctness
    of the DUCC code under stress.

    The cluster simulator has been also been run on a 4GB iMac with 8 simulated Agents, an 8GB MacBook with
    the same configuration, a 32GB iMac with up to 40 simulated Agents. It has also been scaled
    up to run on 8 45G Intel nodes running Linux, simulating 20TB of memory.

    The rest of this chapter describes the mechanics of using these tools.

\section{Cluster Simulation}

    \subsection{Overview}
    Cluster-based tools such as DUCC are very hard to test and debug
    because all interesting problems occur only when the system is
    under stress.  Acquisition of a cluster of sufficient size to 
    expose the interesting problems is usually not practical.

    DUCC's design divorces all the DUCC processes from specific IP
    addresses or node names.  ActiveMq is used as a nameserver and
    packet router so that all messages can be delivered by name,
    irrespective of the physical hardware the destination process
    may reside upon.  

    A DUCC system is comprised of three types of processes (daemons):
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The DUCC management daemons: 
        \begin{itemize}
           \item The Orchestrator (OR). This is the primary point of
             entry to the system and is responsible for managing
             the life cycle of all work in the system.
           \item The Process Manager (PM).  This is responsible for
             managing message flow to and from the DUCC Agents.
           \item The \hyperref[chap:rm]{Resource Manager} (RM). This is responsible for
             apportioning system resources among submitted work 
             (jobs, reservations, services).
           \item The \hyperref[chap:services]{Service Manager} (SM). This is responsible for
             keeping services active and available as needed.
           \item The Web Server (WS). This process listens to all
             the state messages in the system to provide a coherent
             view of DUCC to the outside world.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The DUCC Node Agents, or simply, Agents.  There is
          one Agent running on every physical node.
        \item The ActiveMQ Broker.  All message flow in the system
          is directed through the ActiveMQ broker, with the exception
          of the CLI, (which uses HTTP).
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Normally, the DUCC Agents use the name and IP address of the node 
    they actually do reside upon. This is simply for convenience. 
    It is possible to parametrize the DUCC Agents to report any arbitrary
    name and address to the DUCC.  DUCC components that need to know
    about Node Agents establish subscriptions to the Agent publications
    with ActiveMQ and build up their internal structures from the 
    node identities in the Agent publications.  Processes which normally 
    establish agent listeners are are the RM, PM, and WS.

    It is also possible to parametrize a DUCC agent to cause it to
    report any arbitrary memory size.  Thus, an agent running on a
    2GB machine can be started so that it reports 32GB of memory. This
    parametrization is specifically for testing, of course.

    The ability to parametrize agent identities and memory sizes is what enables 
    cluster simulation.  A control file is used by start-up scripting
    to spawn multiple agents per node, each with unique identities. 

    \subsection{Node Configuration}

    A properties file similar to a Java properties file is used to configure
    simulated nodes.  There are three types o entries in this file:
    \begin{description}
      \item[nodes] This single entry provides the blank-delimited names of the physical nodes
        participating in the simulated cluster.
      \item[memory] This single line consists of a blank-delimited set
        of numbers.  Each number corresponds to some memory size, in
        GB, to be simulated.
      \item[node descriptions] There are one or more of these.  The format
        of each line is
\begin{verbatim}
    [nodename].[memory] = [count]
\end{verbatim}
        where
        \begin{description}
          \item[nodename] is the name of one of the nodes in the {\em nodes}
            line mentioned above.
          \item[memory] is one of the memory sizes given in the {\em memory}
            line mentioned above.
          \item[count] is the number of simulated agents in the indicated
            node, with the indicated memory, to be simulated.
        \end{description}
      \end{description}

      For example, the following simulated cluster configuration defines twenty (20)
      simulated nodes, all to be run on the single physical machine called {\em agentn}.
      The simulated nodes contain a mix of 31GB, 47GB, and 79GB memory sizes.  There
      are 7 31GB nodes, 7 47GB nodes, and 6 79GB nodes.
\begin{verbatim}
# names of nodes in the test cluster
nodes       = agentn

# set of memory sizes to configure
memory      = 31 47 79

# how to configure memories: node.memsize = count
agentn.31 = 7
agentn.47 = 7
agentn.79 = 6
\end{verbatim}

      The nodenames generated by this means are the name of the physical node where
      the agent is spawned, and a numeric id appended, for example,
\begin{verbatim}
  agentn-1
  agentn-2
  agentn-3
    etc.
\end{verbatim}
      
      \subsection{Starting a Simulated Cluster}
      DUCC provides a start-up script in the directory {\tt \duccruntime/examples/systemtest} 
      called {\tt start\_sim}.  

      WARNING: Cluster simulation is intended for DUCC testing, including error injection.  It is
      similar to flying a high-performance fighter jet.  It is intentionally twitchy.  Very little
      checking is done and processes may be started multiple time whether it normally is sane to
      do this.

      To start a simulated cluster, use the {\em start\_sim} script:

      \paragraph{Description:}
      The {\em start\_sim} script is used to start a simulated cluster.
      
      \paragraph{Usage:}
      {\em start\_sim} options

      \paragraph{Options:}
      \begin{description}
        \item[-n, --nodelist {[nodelist]}] where the nodelist is a cluster description as
          described above.
        \item[-c --components {[component list]}].  The component list is a blank-delimited
          list of components including {\em or, rm, sm, pm, ws, broker} to start an
          individual component, or {\em all} to start all of the components.  NOTE: It is
          usually an error to start any of these components more than once.  However 
          {\em start\_sim} allows it, to permit error injection.
      \end{description}
      
    \subsection{Stopping a Simulated Cluster}

    There are two mechanisms for stopping a simulated cluster:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item {\em check\_ducc -k} This looks for all DUCC processes on the nodes in
        \ducchome/resources/ducc.nodes and issues {\em kill -9} to each process.  It
        then removes the Orchestrator lock file.  This is the most violent and
        surest way to stop a simulated DUCC cluster.  In order for this to work,
        be sure to include the names of all physical nodes used in the simulated cluster
        in the DUCC configuration file {\em \duccruntime/resources/ducc.nodes.}  It
        is described in the \hyperref[subsec:admin.check-ducc]{administration section} of the book.

      \item {\em stop\_sim} With no arguments, this attempts to stop all the simulated
        agents and the management daemons using {\em kill -INT}.  It is possible to
        stop individual agents or management nodes by specifying their component IDs.
        The kill signals {\em -KILL, -STOP} and {\em -CONT} are all supported.  This
        allows error injection as well as a more orderly shutdown than 
        {\em check\_ducc -k}.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Note that \hyperref[subsec:admin.check-ducc]{{\em check\_ducc}} is found in 
    {\em \duccruntime/admin}.  The {\em stop\_sim} script is found in {\em
      duccruntime/examples/systemtest}.  
   
    The {\em start\_sim} script creates a file called {\em sim.pids} containing the
    physical node name, Unix process ID (PID), and component ID (ws, sm, or, pm, rm) of
    each started DUCC component.  In the case of agents, each agent is assigned a
    number as a unique id.  These ids are used with {\em stop\_sim} to affect
    specific processes.  If the cluster is stopped without using {\em stop\_sim}, or
    if it simply crashes, this PID file will get out of date.  Fly more carefully
    next time!

    {\em stop\_sim} works as follows:
    \paragraph{Description}
    The {\em stop\_sim} script is used to stop some or all of a simulated cluster.
    
    \paragraph{Usage:}
    {\em stop\_sim} [options]

    \paragraph{Options:}
    \begin{description}
      \item[-c, --component {[component name]}] where the name is one of {\em
        rm, sm, pm, or. ws,}.  {\em Kill -INT} is used to enable orderly shutdown
      unless overridden with -k, -p, or -r as described below.
      \item[-i, --instance {[instance-id]}] where the instance-id is one of the
        agent ids in ``sim.pids''. {\em Kill -INT} is used to enable orderly shutdown
      unless overridden with -k, -p, or -r as described below.
      \item[-k, --kill] Use {\em kill -9} to kill the process.
      \item[-p, --pause] Use {\em kill -STOP} to kill the process.
      \item[-r, --resume] Use {\em kill -CONT} to kill the process.
    \end{description}
    
\section{Job Simulation}

    \subsection{Overview}
     ``Real'' jobs are highly memory and CPU intensive.  For testing and simulation
     purposes, the jobs need not use anywhere close to their declared memory, and
     need not consume any CPU at all.  The FixedSleepAE is a UIMA analytic that
     is given a time, in milliseconds, and all it does is sleep for that period
     of time and then exit.  By running many of these in a simulated cluster
     it is possible to get all the DUCC administrative processes to behave 
     as if there is a real load on the system when in fact all the nodes and
     jobs are taking minimal resources.

     The FixedSleepAE is delivered CASs by the FixedSleepCR.  This CR reads
     a standard Java properties file, using the property ``elapsed'' to derive the
     set of sleep times.  On each call to the CR's ``getNext()'' method, the next
     integer from ``elapsed'' is fetched, packaged into a CAS, and shipped to
     ActiveMQ where it is picked up by the next available FixedSleepAE.

     The test driver is given a control file with the names of all the jobs to be
     submitted in the current run, and the elapsed time to wait between submission
     of each job. Each job name corresponds to a file that is not an actual
     DUCC specification, but rather the description of a DUCC specification.  Each
     description is a simple Java properties file.

     To submit a job, the test driver reads the next job description file
     derive the number of 
     threads, the simulated user, the desired (simulated) memory for the job,
     (possibly) the service ID, and the scheduling class for the job.  From these
     it constructs a DUCC \hyperref[sec:cli.ducc-submit]{job specification} and submits it to DUCC.

     Scripting is used to read the job meta-descriptors and generate a control
     file that submits the job set with a large set of variations.  The same scripting
     reads each meta-descriptor and modifies it according to the specific parameters
     of the run, adjust things such as scheduling class, memory size, etc.
     
     \subsection{Job meta-descriptors}
     For each simulated job in a run, a meta-descriptor must be constructed.  These may be
     constructed ``by hand'', or via local scripting, for example from log analysis.  (The
     packaged meta-descriptors are generated from logs of actual workloads.)

     A meta-descriptor must contain the following properties:
     \begin{description}
       \item[tod] This specifies a virtual ``time of day of submission'', starting from time 0, specified
         in units of milliseconds, when the job is to be submitted.  During job generation, this may
         be used to enforce precise timing of submission of the jobs.
       \item[elapsed] This is a space-delimited set of numbers.  Each number represents the elapsed time,
         in milliseconds, for a single work item.  There must be one time for each work item.  
         These numbers are placed into CASs by the job's Job Driver and delivered to each Job Process.
         For example,
         if this job is to consist of 5 work items of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 seconds each, specify
\begin{verbatim}
    elapsed = 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000
\end{verbatim}
       \item[threads] This is the number of threads per Job Process.  It is translated to the
         {\em process\_thread\_count} parameter in the job specification.
       \item[user] This is the name of the user who owns the job.  It may be any string at
         all.  If DUCC is started in {\em test} mode, this will be shown as the owner of 
         the job in the webserver and the logs.
       \item[memory] This is the amount of memory to be requested for the job, translating
         to the job specification's {\em process\_memory\_size} parameter.
       \item[class] This is the scheduling class for the job.
       \item[machines] This is the maximum number of processes to be allocated for the
         job, corresponding to the {\em process\_deployments\_max} parameter.
       \end{description}
       
       For example:
\begin{verbatim}
tod = 0
elapsed = 253677 344843 349342 392883 276264 560153 162850 744822 431210 91188 840262 843378 
threads = 4
user = Rodrigo
memory = 20
class = normal
machines = 11
\end{verbatim}

       All the job meta-descriptors for a run must be placed into a single directory.


     \subsection{Prepare Descriptors}
     \label{subsec:simulation.run-description}
     A  {\em prepare descriptor} is also a
     standard Java properties file.  This defines where the set of meta descriptors resides,
     where to place the modified meta-files, how to assign scheduling classes to the
     jobs, how to apportion memory sizes, how to apportion services, how long the total
     run should last, and how to compress sleep times.  

     All parts of the run are randomized, but the randomization can be made deterministic
     between runs by specifying a seed to the random number generator.

     Properties include
     \begin{description}
       \item[random.seed] This is the random-number generator seed to be used for
         creating the run.
       \item[src.dir] This is the directory containing the input-set of meta-specification
         files.
       \item[dest.dir] This is the directory that will contain the updated meta-specification
         files.
       \item[scheduling.classes] This is a blank-delimited list of the scheduling classes to
         be randomly assigned to the jobs.  
       \item[scheduling.classes.{[name]}] Here, {\em name} is the name of one of the 
         scheduling classes listed above.  The value is a weight, to be used to affect
         the distribution of scheduling classes among the jobs.
       \item[job.memory] This is a blank-delimited list of memory sizes to be randomly
         assigned to each job.
       \item[job.memory.{[men]}]] Here, {\em mem} is one of the memory sizes specified
         above.  The value is a weight, used to affect the distribution of memory sizes
         among the jobs.
       \item[job.services] This is a blank-delimited list of a service id, where the id
         is one of the services specified in the {\em services.boot} control file.
       \item[job.services.{[id]}] Here {\em id} is one of the ids specified in the
         job.services line above.  The value is a weight, used to affect the distribution
         of services among the jobs.

       \item[submission.spread]  This is the time, in seconds the set of job submissions
         is to be spread across.  The jobs are submitted at random times such that the
         total time between submitting the first job and the last job is approximately
         this number.
       \item[compression] For each sleep time in the job, divide the actual value by 
         this number.  This allows testers to use the actual elapsed time from real
         jobs, and compress the total run time so it fits approximately into the submission
         spread.

         For example, if a collection of jobs was originally run over 24 hours, but 
         you want to run a simulation with approximately the same type of submission
         that last only 15 minutes, specify a submission spread of 900 (15 minutes) and
         a compression of 96.
     \end{description}

     Here is a sample run configuration file:
\begin{verbatim}
# control file to create a random-like submission of jobs for batch submission
# This represents jobs submitted over approximately 36 hours real time
# Compression of 96 and spread 920 gives a good 15-20 minute test on test system with
# 136 15-G shares

random.seed                   = 0         # a number, for determinate randoms
                                          # or TOD, and the seed will use
                                          # current time of day

src.dir                       = jobs.in   # where the jobs are
dest.dir                      = jobs      # where to put prepared jobs

scheduling.classes            = normal    # classes
scheduling.classes.normal     = 100

job.memory                    = 28 37     # memorys to assign
job.memory.28                 = 50
job.memory.37                 = 50

job.services                  = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
job.services.0                = 25
job.services.1                = 25
job.services.2                = 25
job.services.3                = 25
job.services.4                = 25
job.services.5                = 25
job.services.6                = 25
job.services.7                = 25

submission.spread             = 920       # number of *seconds* to try to spread submission over 

compression                   = 96        # comporession for timings
\end{verbatim}
     
     \subsection{Services}
     \label{subsec:simulation.services}
     It is possible to run the FixedSleepAE as a UIMA-AS service, with each job
     specifying a dependency on the service, and the indicated service doing the
     actual sleeping on behalf of the job.

     These variants on services are supported:
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item Registered services, started by reference,
       \item Registered services, started by the simulator,
       \item Standalone services, started independently of DUCC and discovered
         by reference from a job.
     \end{enumerate}

     To use these simulated services, configure a ``service boot'' file and reference
     the services from the job generation config file.

     Properties required in the service boot file include:
     \begin{description}
       \item[register] This specifies registered services.  The value is a blank delimited
         list of pseudo IDs for the registered services.
       \item[start] This specifies which of the registered services to automatically 
         start.  The value is some subset of the pseudo IDS specified under {\em register}
       \item[standalone] This specifies the pseudo IDs of the standalone (non-DUCC) services.
       \item[instances\_{[id]}] Here {\em id} is one of the IDs specified for {\em submit,
           register,} or {\em standalone}.  The value is the number of instances of that
         specific service to set up.
     \end{description}
     
     \paragraph{Service pseudo IDs}
     DUCC is packaged with 10 pre-configured services that use the FixedSleepAE. ALl of these
     services behave identically, the only difference is their endpoints, which allows
     the simulated runs to activate and use multiple independent services.  Because the
     endpoints are in the various UIMA XML service descriptors, it is necessary to use
     exactly these IDs when generating a test run.  Thus, the only valid pseudo-ids
     for service configuration are {\em 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

     These {\em service ids} are used on the job configuration file to establish a
     weighted distribution of service use among the jobs.

     Here is a sample service configuration file:
\begin{verbatim}
# register these services, 2 instances each
register 0 1 2 3
instances_0 2
instances_1 2
instances_2 2
instances_3 2

# start these registered services
start 2 3 

# start 2 standalone services
standalone 4 5 
instances_4 1
instances_5 1
\end{verbatim}

     \subsection{Generating a Job Set}

     The {\em prepare} script, found in \duccruntime/examples/systemtest is used
     to generate a test run from the control files described above.
     To use it, execute
\begin{verbatim}
prepare [config-file]
\end{verbatim}
     where {\em config file} is the \hyperref[subsec:simulation.run-description]{run description} file
     described above.

     This script reads the meta-specification in the {\em jobs.in} directive of the
     config-file, generates a set of meta-specification files into the {\em jobs.out}
     directory, and creates a control file, {\em job.ctl}.  The {\em job.ctl} file is used
     by the simulation driver to submit all the jobs.
     

\subsection{Running the Test Driver}
    A test run is driven from the script {\em \duccruntime/examples/systemtest/runducc}. This
    script supports a large number of options intended to inject errors and otherwise
    perturb a run.

    To use the test driver, first create a job collection as described above.  This will
    generate a file called {\em job.ctl} in the test directory containing the {\em prepare}
    file.

    Then execute:
\begin{verbatim}
    runducc -d jobdir -b batchfile options...
\end{verbatim}
    where the various parameters and options include:
    \begin{description}
      \item[-d jobdir] The jobdir is the directory containing the {\em prepare} file and the
        {\em job.ctl} file as describe in the previous section.
      \item[-b batchfile] The batchfile is usually {\em job.ctl} as generated by the
        prepare script.  (This file may be hand-edited to create custom runs outside
        of the {\em prepare} script.)
      \item[--AE] This specifies to run all jobs as CR and AE.  This is the default and
        need not be specified.
      \item[--DD] This specifies to run all jobs as CR and DD.  The jobs are generated as
        DD-style jobs, as opposed to AE.
      \item[--SE cfg] This specifies to run all jobs using services, as generated by the {\em
          prepare} script.  The parameter is the \hyperref[subsec:simulation.services]{service
          config file} as described above. When specified, the driver starts the services
        as configured, pauses a bit to let them start up, and generated every job with a
        dependency on one of the services.
      \item[-i time-in-sec] If specified, this forces each AE to spend a minimum of the indicated time
        in it's initialization method (also a sleep). If not specified, the default is
        10 seconds. The actual time is controlled by the {\em -r} (range) option.
      \item[-r time-in-sec] This specifies the top range for initialization.  The service
        will spend the time specified in {\em -i}, PLUS a random value from 1 to
        the time specified in {\em -r} in its initialization phase.
      \item[--IB] The Job Process will leak memory in it's initialization phase until it is killed, hopefully by
        DUCC, but possibly by the operating system.  {\em Use with care.}.
      \item[--PB] The job Process will leak memory in it's processing phase until it is killed, hopefully 
        by DUCC, but possibly by the operation system. {\em Use with care.}
      \item[-m size-in-gb] Memory override.  Use this value for all jobs, overriding the value
        in the generated meta-specification file.
      \item[-n max-Number-of-processes] Max machine override.  If specified, this overrides the configured process max
        from the job control file.  Specify the max as $0$ and no maximum will be submitted with the job,
        causing the scheduler to try to allocated the largest possible number of processes to the job.
      \item[-p time-in-seconds] Generated the {\em time-in-seconds} as the maximum processing time
        for a work item.  DUCC will terminate any work item that exceeds this time.
      \item[-w, --watch] Submit every job with the {\em wait\_for\_completion} flag. This runs the
        driver in multi-threaded mode, with each thread monitoring the progress of a job.
      \item[-x rate] This specifies an expected error rate for execution phase in a job process, from 0-100 (a
        percentage).  When specified, each job process uses a random number generator to determine
        the probability that is would crash, if if that probability is within the specified rate, it
        generates a random exception.
      \item[-y rate]  This specifies an expected error rate for initialization phase in a job process, from 0-100 (a
        percentage).  When specified, each job process uses a random number generator to determine
        the probability that is would crash, if if that probability is within the specified rate, it
        generates a random exception.
    \end{description}

    For an expected error-free run, only the -b and -d options are needed.

    
\section{Pre-Packaged Tests}
    Three test suites are provided using the mechanisms described in the previous section:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A 15-minute run comprising approximately 30 jobs.  This includes configuration for
        single-class submission, mixed class submission, and one configured to maximize
        resource fragmentation.
      \item A 30-minute run comprising approximately 33 jobs. This includes a single
        configuration.
      \item a 24-hour run comprising approximately 260 jobs.  This also includes configurations
        for single-class submission, mixed classes, and fragmentation. {\em Note: this run has
          been reconfigured to run in 12 hours, and has been successfully been configured
          to complete in 6 hours.  This can create a significant load on the DUCC processes.}
    \end{itemize}

     The configurations are found in the \duccruntime/examples/systemtest directory
     and are in sub directories called, 
     \begin{itemize}
       \item mega-15-min
       \item mega-30-min
       \item mega-24-hour
     \end{itemize}
     
     To run these tests:
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item Create a node configuration.  A sample configuration to generate
         52 simulated nodes, and which assumes the
         physical machines for the simulation are called {\em sys290, sys291, sys292}
         and {\em sys293} is supplied in \duccruntime/examples/systemtest. Change
         the node names to the names of real machines, making any other adjustments
         needed.
       \item Update your {\em \duccruntime/resources/ducc.mpdes} so that all the real node names specified
         int the simulated node file are included.
       \item Update your {\em \duccruntime/resources/ducc.properties} so the 
         {\em ducc.head} is specified as the {\em real, physical} machine where you will
         start the simulated cluster.
       \item Be sure the {\em job driver} nodepool, if configured in
         {\em \duccruntime/resources/ducc.classes}, specifies the name of one of the
         simulated nodes.
       \item Generate the job set.  For example, to generate the job set for the
         15-minute run,
\begin{verbatim}
   cd $DUCC_HOME/examples/systemtest
   ./prepare mega-15-min/jobs.prepare
\end{verbatim}
         \item Start the simulated cluster (Assuming your simulated node file is called
           {\em 52.simulated.nodes}:
\begin{verbatim}
   cd $DUCC_HOME/examples/systemtest
   ./start_sim -c all -n 52.simulated.nodes
\end{verbatim}
         \item Use the webserver (or for advanced users, log files work also), to insure
           everything came up and the job driver node has been assigned.
         \item Start the run:
\begin{verbatim}
   cd $DUCC_HOME/examples/systemtest
   ./runducc -d mega-15-min -b job.ctl
\end{verbatim}             
         \end{enumerate}
