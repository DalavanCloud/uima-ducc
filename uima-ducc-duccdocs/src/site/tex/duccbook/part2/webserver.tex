\chapter{DUCC Web Server}

    The DUCC Web Server default address is accessed from the URL http://wshost:42133. Each local
    installation configures the host for "wshost" and may override the default port of 42133.

    The Webserver is designed to be mostly self-documenting. The design is intentionally simple 
    and contains a link to this document. Column headers and reason/state codes have display a short 
    description if you hover your mouse over it. 

    The columns can all be sorted by clicking on the column headers.

    \section{Common Links}

        Every page contains a common header containing links and controls. The links permit navigation
        to other content at the site. The controls provide page-wise configuration of the content at
        that page.

        The following links are available on every page of the web server: 

        \begin{description}
          \item[Authentication] \hfill \\ 
            Authentication is in order to cancel jobs and reservations, to create a
            reservation, and to perform administration. It is not required to simply view the pages.

            \begin{itemize}
              \item Login - Authenticate and start a session with the Web Server.             
              \item Logout - Terminate the Web Server session 
            \end{itemize}

          \item[Preferences]
            Set preferences for table style, date style, filters, etc.
            
          \item[DuccBook] \hfill \\
            This is a link to the HTML version of the document you are reading.

          \item[Jobs] \hfill \\
            This navigates to the Jobs page, showing all the jobs in the system.

          \item[Reservations] \hfill \\
            This navigates to the Reservations page, showing all the reservations
            in the system and provides a button that can be used to request new reservations. 

          \item[Services] \hfill \\
            This navigates to the Services page, showing all the services in the
            system.

          \item[System] \hfill \\
            This opens a submenu with system-related links:
            \begin{itemize}
              \item[] Administration - This opens a page with administrative functions. 
              \item[] Classes - This shows all the scheduling classes defined to the system. 
              \item[] Daemons - This shows the status of DUCC's management processes.
