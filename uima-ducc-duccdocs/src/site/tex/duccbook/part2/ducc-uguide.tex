    \paragraph{The DUCC Job Descriptor}
    The DUCC Job Descriptor includes properties to enable automated management and scale-out 
    over large computing clusters.  The job descriptor includes
    \begin{itemize}
      \item References to the various UIMA components required by the job (CR, CM, AE, CC, and maybe DD)
      \item Scale-out requirements: number of processes, number of threads per process, etc
      \item Environment requirments: log directory, working directory, environment variables, etc,
      \item JVM paramenters
      \item Scheduling class
      \item Error-handling preferences: acceptable failure counts, timeouts, etc
      \item Debugging and monitoring requirements and preferences
    \end{itemize}
  

    The Command Line Interface is provided in several forms:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A Java executable jar.
      \item A script.
      \item Direct invocation of each commands's {\tt main}.
    \end{enumerate}

    When using the executable jars and scripts the full execution environment is estableshed
    silently.  When directly invoking a command's {\tt main} one must set the java {\tt CLASSPATH} to
    specify the appropriate jar for the command, as described in subsequent sections.

    The following commands are provided:
    \begin{description}
    \item[ducc\_submit] Submit a job for ececution.
    \item[ducc\_cancel] Cancel a job in progress.
    \item[ducc\_reserve] Request a reservation of full or partial machines.
    \item[ducc\_unreserve] Cancel a reservation.
    \item[ducc\_monitor] Monitor the progress of a job that is already submitted.
    \item[ducc\_process\_submit] Submit an arbitrary process (managed reservation) for execution.
    \item[ducc\_process\_cancel] Cancel an arbitrary process.
    \item[ducc\_service\_submit] Submit a (non-registered) service instance for execution.
    \item[ducc\_service\_cancel] Cancel a (non-registered) service instance.
    \item[ducc\_services] Register, unregister, start, stop, modify, and query a service.
    \end{description}
    
    The next section describes these commands in detail.
