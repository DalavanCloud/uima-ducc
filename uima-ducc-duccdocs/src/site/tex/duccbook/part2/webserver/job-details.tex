    \label{sec:ws-job-details}
    This page shows details of all the processes that run in support of a job. 
    The Jobs page contains the following columns: 

    \begin{description}

        \item[Id] \hfill \\
          This is the DUCC process id (not the Operating System's processid). Process 0 is
          alwyas the Job Driver. It is hyperlinked to jd.out.log.

        \item[Log] \hfill \\
          This is the log name for the process. It is hyperlinked to the log itself.

        \item[Size] \hfill \\
          This is the size of the log in MB. If you find you have trouble viewing the log
          from the web server it could be because it is too big to view in the server and needs to
          be check directly.

        \item[Hostname] \hfill \\
          This is the name of the node where the process ran.

        \item[PID] \hfill \\
          This is the Operating Systems' PID for the process.

        \item[State:Scheduler] \hfill \\
          This shows the Resesource Manager state of the job. It is one of:

          \begin{description}
              \item[Allocated] - The node is still allocated for this job by the RM 
              \item[Deallocated] - The resource manager has deallocated the shares for the job on
                this node.
          \end{description}

        \item[Reason:Schedule] \hfill \\
          This shows why a process is terminated, from the system's point
          of view.
            \begin{description}          
                \item[AutonomousStop] - The process terminated unexpectedly of its own accord ("crashed") for no 
                  detectable reason.. 
                  
                \item[JobCanceled] - The job was canceled by the user or a system administrator. 
                  
                \item[JobCompleted] - The process is canceled because of DUCC restart. 
                  
                \item[JobFailure] - The job failure limit is exceeded, causing the job to be canceled by the JD. 
                  
                \item[Exception] - The process is terminated by the JD exception handler. 
                  
                \item[Failed] - The process is terminated by the Agent because the JP wrapper was able to detect and 
                  communicate a fatal condition (Exception) in the pipeline.. 
                  
                \item[FailedInitialization] - The process is terminated because the initialization step failed. 
                  
                \item[Forced] - The node is preempted by RM for other work because of fair share. 
                  
                \item[InitializationTimeout] - The initialization phase exceeded the configured timeout. 
                  
                \item[Killed] - The agent terminated the process for some reason. 
                  
                \item[Stopped] - The job is winding down, there's no more work for this node, so it stops. 
                  
                \item[Voluntary] - The job is winding down, there's no more work for this node, so it stops. 
                  
                \item[Unknown] - None of the above. This is an exceptional condition. Check the JP and JD logs for 
                  possible causes..                   
            \end{description}

          \item[State:Agent] \hfill \\
            If there's an error detected only by the agent, this shows the Agent's reason for
            a process's death.

          \item[Reason:Agent]I\hfill \\
            f there's an error detected only by the agent, this shows the Agent's reason for
            a process's death.
            
          \item[Time:Init] \hfill \\

          \item[\%GC]P\hfill \\
            rocess percentage of time spent in garbage collections, relative to total of
            initialization + run times.
            
          \item[CPU] \hfill \\
            Cumulative CPU time for the process.
            
          \item[\%RSS] \hfill \\
            Resident Storage Size, as a percentage of process memory requirement in job
            specification.
            
          \item[Time:Avg] \hfill \\
            Average seconds spent per work item in the process.
            
          \item[Time:min] \hfill \\
            This is the minimum time spent per work item in the process.
            
          \item[Time:max] \hfill \\
            This is the minimum time spent per work item in theprocess.
            
          \item[Done] \hfill \\
            This is the number of work items processed in this process.
            
          \item[Error] \hfill \\
