                  \item[Premature] - The job was terminated for some unknown reason before all work items were 
                    processed. Check the JP logs for details.

                  \item[ResourcesUnavailable] - The Resource Manager (RM) is unable to allocate resources for 
                    the job. For non-preemptable jobs this could be because the limit on that type of allocaiton is 
                    reached, or all the nodes are already allocated and work cannot be preempted to make space for 
                    it. For all jobs, it could be because the job class is invalid.
