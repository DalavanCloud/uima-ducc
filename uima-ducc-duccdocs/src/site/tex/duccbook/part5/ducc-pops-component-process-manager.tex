    There is one \varProcessManager~per \varDUCC~cluster.
    
    The duties of the \varProcessManager~are:
    \textit{
      \input{part5/c01-PM.tex}
    }
      
    The \varProcessManager~provides essential functionality for operation of the
    \varDUCC~system.
    
    The \varProcessManager~both publishes and receive reports.  
    The \varProcessManager~receives \varOrchestrator~publications comprising
    Jobs, Reservations, and Services.
    The \varProcessManager~distributes two publications at regular intervals.
    One is heartbeat information to notify the \varOrchestrator~and
    \varWebServer~that the \varProcessManager~is alive.  
    The other is compacted \varAgent-destined information regarding
    processes that need to be started, stopped or modified.
    
    The main function of the \varProcessManager~is to efficiently manage
    the distributed \varAgents~each of which manages processes running
    locally on its own respective \varNodeMachineComputer.
    The \varProcessManager~interprets the \varOrchestrator~publications and 
    redistributes only the essentials to the collection of distributed
    \varAgents~who each independently act to bring the 
    state of locally deployed processes into compliance.
